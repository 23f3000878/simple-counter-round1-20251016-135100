## Code Explanation

This application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main components include:

- **HTML**: The structure of the application, containing buttons and the display for the count.
- **CSS**: Basic styling that gives the application its initial appearanceâ€”this can be enhanced for greater visual appeal.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the logic for incrementing, decrementing, and resetting the counter through event listeners tied to the buttons.
